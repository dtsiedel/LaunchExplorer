## Setup
### Token Setup
The file `token.txt` should be populated with the Cesium.js token. I've put
this file in the .gitignore so as not to broadcast it to the world. Sign
up at https://cesium.com/ to get your own, and put it in that file (with
permission such that Node can open it).

The file `maps_token.txt` should be populated with your Google maps token.
I've likewise .gitignored this one.

### Run
`node app.js`
